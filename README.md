# IFNL-Evolution: Comparative Genomics of Interferon Lambda Genes

[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.1-4baaaa.svg)](./md/code_of_conduct.md)

## Overview
**IFNL-Evolution** is a reproducible, sequence-oriented resource for the comparative genomic analysis of interferon lambda (IFNλ) genes.  
It has been built using the [GLUE](http://glue-tools.cvr.gla.ac.uk/) software framework, which provides a database-backed environment for standardised sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses.

Interferon lambda (IFNλ1–4) are cytokines that play critical roles in mucosal immunity. Natural variation in IFNλs has been linked to infection outcomes and therapeutic responses, highlighting the importance of understanding their diversity and evolution.

This repository contains the project files, reference-constrained alignments, and configurations needed to reproduce and extend IFNλ evolutionary analyses.

## Features
- Curated database of IFNλ sequences with metadata.
- **Reference-constrained multiple sequence alignments** for reproducible comparisons.
- Phylogenetic framework for exploring IFNλ diversity.
- Structural and functional annotations of IFNλ reference sequences.
- Docker image for full reproducibility.

## Quick start
The recommended way to run IFNL-Evolution is via [Docker](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/IFNL-Evolution/wiki/Docker-Installation):

## Data sources
- [NCBI Nucleotide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore)  
- [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy)  
- [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org)
